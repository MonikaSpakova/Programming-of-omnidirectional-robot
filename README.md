# Bachelor thesis

In this work we deal with designing and control of two robotic vehicles. For the first vehicle, we use the EV3 control unit from the LEGO MINDSTORMS series. The second robot works using the WEMOS ESP32 module. The aim of the work was, for these vehicles, to use mecanum wheels. The main advantage is the movement to all directions. It was also necessary to manually control the robots.

For the second robot, we used the Arduino IDE program. Using various sensors, we were ready to program robot for autonomous parking. This included finding a parking space, finding out its size and then, parking. We have created a mobile application to manipulate the control, using the ESP32 microcontroller.
